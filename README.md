# Research_Co-op_ML
As a bioinformatics and machine learning research intern, I analyzed pancreatic cancer data under the watchful eye of an industry research professional using Python data science tools such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn, creating a statistical model using a random forest algorithm that yielded 98% prediction accuracy.

Using statistical algorithms, I found which factors (alcohol consumption, age, etc.) contributed the most to pancreatic cancer by analyzing the generated statistical model and computing odds-ratios, feature importances, and other topics of statistical interest.

I visualized my findings and machine learning model using Matplotlib, creating various charts analyzing the random forest model, contributions. This github repository hosts the code that was used to create the machine learning model and generate the charts.

Ultimately, a research paper was developed from the analyzed data, that was submitted for publishing in the Journal of Student Science and Technology.

Here is a link to the paper submitted for publication: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jmZmZIqWriUMVfBANGF8eCjqSguM4q_r/view?usp=sharing. It holds the various plots and visualizations generated, and gives insight into the depth and scale of the investigation.
